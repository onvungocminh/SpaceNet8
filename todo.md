*Some brainstormed todo (feel free to add):*


* Baseline implementation (network, pre-, postprocessing)
* Building/road detection network(s)
* Flooded pixels segmentation
* Tests on fusion steps (at pixel step of at feature step?)
* Pre-processing: cloud masking, atmospheric correction
* Post-processing: road graph building, road speed estimation, building polygonization
* Improvement: fixing broken connections on road, vegetation detection, etc.
* Docker (product packaging)
