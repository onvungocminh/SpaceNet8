*Some brainstormed todo (feel free to add):*

* Baseline implementation (network, preprocessing, postprocessing)
* Building/road detection network(s)
* Flooded pixels segmentation
* Tests on fusion steps (at pixel step of at feature step?)
* Pre-processing:
** cloud masking
** atmospheric correction
* Post-processing:
** road graph building,
** road speed estimation,
** building outline polygonization
* Improvement: fixing broken connections on road, vegetation detection, etc.
* Docker (product packaging)
